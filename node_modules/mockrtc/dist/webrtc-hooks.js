/*
 * In this file, we define hooks which can automatically wrap an RTCPeerConnection so that the
 * normal calls to initialize a connection instead proxy the connection through MockRTC.
 *
 * This is quite complicated and confusing! There's four connection endpoints to be aware of:
 * - The original RTCPeerConnection that's being hooked here to connect to a mock ('internal')
 * - A MockRTC connection with an associated MockRTCPeer that it will actually connect to ('mock')
 * - The original remote peer that we're connecting to ('remote')
 * - A MockRTC external connection that will connect to the remote peer ('external')
 *
 * The connection structure works like so:
 * INTERNAL <--> MOCK <-?-> EXTERNAL <--> REMOTE
 *
 * Internal+Mock and External+Remote are connected via real WebRTC connections. Mock+External are
 * connected within MockRTC once mockConnection.proxyTrafficTo(externalConnection) is called,
 * which happens if/when a proxy step is reached (i.e. this depends on the configuration of the
 * mock peer).
 *
 * Note that in extra complicated cases, both peers might be hooked, in which case REMOTE is
 * actually the EXTERNAL for a second mirrored structure. We can mostly ignore this as it's
 * handled implicitly.
 */
/**
 * Hooks a given RTCPeerConnection so that all connections it creates are automatically proxied
 * through the given MockRTCPeer.
 *
 * This allows you to capture traffic without modifying your WebRTC code: you can create
 * offers/answers and signal them to a remote client as normal, and both the local and remote
 * connections will connect to MockRTC instead.
 *
 * What happens once they connect depends on the configuration of the given peer. This mocked
 * local connection will follow the steps defined by the peer, so may receive mocked messages
 * injected there, or delays, or anything else. The remote peer will receive nothing until
 * a proxy step is reached (if ever), at which point the local & remote peers will be able to
 * talking directly, although all traffic will still be proxied through MockRTC for logging
 * and analysis/validation elsewhere.
 *
 * It is possible to proxy both real peers in a connection, potentially with different mock
 * peers so that they experience different behaviours during the connection.
